# Collaboration
🖌️ I am currently looking for **graphics designers** to design things such as **icons, wallpaper, backgrounds, stylesheets, videogame characters**, because i am not too good in graphical design at all.

If You are interested in collaboration with me, **don't be afraid of [contacting me](https://github.com/COOKIE-1816/COOKIE-1816/edit/main/README.md#how-to-reach-me)!**
